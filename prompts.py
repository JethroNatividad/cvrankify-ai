    Extract skills from resume text that was extracted from a PDF (may have formatting issues).

      Example: "Troubleshooting: Software, Hardware" â†’ ["Software","Hardware"]
    - Deduplicate case-insensitively, keeping first appearance's capitalization.
    - Preserve original wording and qualifiers (e.g., "Photoshop (Basic Layout)").
